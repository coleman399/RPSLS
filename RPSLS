Game Rules:

How do we play a "best of three" game?
1. Welcome
2. Display the rules (how to play)
3. Info about game format (best of 3)
4. Choose game mode (PvP or PvE)
5. Ask for player names
6. P1 selects their gesture
7. P2 selects their gesture
8. Compare our two gestures
    -Same thing? No points!
    -P1 is winner
    -P2 is winner
9. Declare winner and give them 1 point
10. Check scores to see if someone has 2 pts (best 2/3)
11. If no winner, loop back to step 6 and go again!
12. If there is a winner, congrats!
